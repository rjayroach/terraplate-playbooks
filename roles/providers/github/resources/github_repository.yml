# The load vars is responsible to merge the values from component + manifest_component
# and ensuring that all the five top level keys have a default dict with appropriate defaults
# e.g. each argument definition default hash is { required: no, variable: no, description: none, refernece_from:{}}
# arguments, attributes and variables are merged into a compoent.metadata so their values dont' stop on actual values
# Tvalues and provisioners get merged directly into the component. So the result component is:
